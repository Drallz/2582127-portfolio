I learned that the repository is dedicated on commiting , adding , merging and switching through branches. The introduction provided a concise guide on how to install the package and highlighted its key features, such as real-time rendering and custom themes. Additionally, it clarified the licensing terms and pointed me toward the documentation for more advanced usage examples. Finally, the section on community guidelines was helpful in understanding how to properly report bugs or request features.
